## Flashy

Flashy is an application that allows a student to create, view, and organize flashcards.

Flashcards are a common and very successful technique used by students to prepare for upcoming tests and examinations. However, physical flashcards can be easily lost, forgotten, and/or damaged through wear-and-tear before they have exhausted their use. Losing flashcards will often lead to gaps in one’s knowledge while studying (and also in one’s wallet) resulting in a frustrating experience. The solution to this problem is to create flashcards electronically and view them anywhere so that the utility of flashcards remains while providing enhanced features that wouldn't be available when using physical flashcards.

The application will help users stay organized by using several sorting and categorization tools. An example of this is being able to sort the decks of flashcards into categories to help efficiency when studying. The inclusion of timed quizzing games will help the user stay interested and motivated throughout their study session. Also, this introduces an aspect of competitiveness that will engage the user to continue studying. Thus, turning a tedious activity into something fun and addicting. 

The typical user group is projected to be students in official educational institutions, however, it should be easily utilizable by any other group of people, such as those that are learning music or a new language. Therefore, the usage of this application should not require any extensive academic knowledge. 

This project is valuable because it will allow students to be able to easily and quickly study for exams, tests, quizzes or assignments. Additionally, since it will be developed for android, it will be easily accessible to those who need it due to the popularity and ubiquity of the android operating system. This application will attempt to rectify some of the major problems that other applications have not fixed, and thus provide a better user experience than anything else currently available.

The success criteria for this project is to try to improve the grades of the users by at least +0.5 GPA over a semester (or approximately 4 months). In situations where the user is not in an official educational institution, such as those learning a new language, the success criteria will be to ensure that the learner has memorized at least 50 of 100 flashcards over a 4-month period. The learner will be able to test this using a quiz mode which gives a score to the learner based off how many flashcards they have guessed correctly.
