Also, as a team, complete a retrospective activity based on your work from the previous iteration: discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked, and how it can be improved in this iteration (do this early!). Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective). Also include a chart (as an image) showing the 2 data points of project velocity from the last two iterations. Submit with this iteration a short (500 word written) description of what you have discussed, as a file called RETROSPECTIVE.md in your git repository.
