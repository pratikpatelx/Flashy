Vision Statement
----------------

Flashy is an application that allows anyone reviewing study material to create, view, and organize digital flashcards, from anywhere.

Flashcards are a common and successful technique used by students to study and prepare for upcoming tests and examinations. However, using a physical medium introduces numerous potential issues and complications. Physical flashcards can be lost, forgotten, or damaged before they have exhausted their use. Losing a flashcard will lead to gaps in the knowledge gained from studying, which can result in both a frustrating experience and lost marks. In addition, having access to a wide variety of physical flashcards for multiple subjects necessitates the creation and maintenance of a physical filing system.

Our solution is an application for electronic flashcards that can be viewed anywhere. The application will maintain the function and utility of flashcards, while providing enhanced features that would not be possible with the physical alternative.

The application will help users create a robust library of flashcards for review by allowing them to create flashcards with various types of questions, as well as offering several tools for their management and organization. An example of the benefits this would provide is the ability to sort flashcards into decks, and those decks into various categories, which allows for greater efficiency while studying as well as flexibility between units and subjects. Options such as timed quizzes will help the user stay motivated throughout their study session and simulate the experience of an actual test by running through multiple questions in a limited amount of time. This introduces an objective measure of progress, along with an aspect of competitiveness that will engage the user to continue studying, helping transform a tedious activity into something fun and addicting. 

This product is valuable because it will aid its users significantly in reviewing unfamiliar material, and preparing for exams, tests, and assignments. Additionally, since it will be developed for Android, it will be easily accessible to those who need it due to the popularity and ubiquity of the Android operating system. In addition, the application will attempt to rectify some of the problems that similar products have failed to address and in doing so, providing an improved user experience. 

The success criteria for this project is to try to improve the grades of the users by at least +0.5 GPA over a 4-month period, or semester. For users not enrolled in an official educational institution, the success criteria will be to ensure that the user can correctly answer at least 30% more flashcards in a given deck, at the end of a 4-month period. This improvement can be measured objectively by scoring in the timed quiz mode, tested at both the beginning and end of the period.

Users
-----

The typical user group is projected to be students in official educational institutions. However, it should be a helpful application for anyone with something to learn or review, such as music or a new language. Therefore, the application will be accessible for regular humans and its usage of this application should not require any extensive academic or technical knowledge.
