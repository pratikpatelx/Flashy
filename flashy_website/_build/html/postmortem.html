<h2>What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-would-you-do-differently-if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the main changes we would make if we had a chance to start over would be to learn the new technology required for this project. Having to learn Android Studio in addition to implementing HSQLDB was a challenge. Having a solid grasp of the semantics of this technology and how it functions before jumping straight into implementation would be a more efficient use of time. Taking the time to fully understand the technology before trying to implement an application feature in an unfamiliar environment would have a helped a great deal in the design process.</p>
<p>Another change in our approach to this project would be coming to conclusions quicker in the design of our application. Too much time was spent pondering different ideas of each feature and the approach to the projects design. Many ideas were different from one another and it was difficult to choose which idea would be seen within our application. Creating a timeline of when implementation would need to start and forcing an idea to be chosen would be a better use of time.</p>

<h2>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-took-the-most-time-the-least-any-surprises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The component of the project that took the most time was surprisingly learning the new technologies required for this project. Getting familiar with Android Studio and its environment took a lot more time than expected. This is because there were many different nuances that Android Studio brought to the table that has been different compared to what our group has previously faced. Learning what the workflow of creating an android application would look like and how to tackle a problem from this perspective was one of the oversights.</p>
<p>The part of this project that took the least amount of time was implementing the variations of flashcards, naturally. Since our application used inheritance for creating different flashcards objects, it was easy to implement since the foundation was already set.</p>

<h2>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-did-you-learn-about-team-or-large-project-development-what-will-you-start-doing-keep-doing-or-stop-doing-next-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Working in a big team and doing large project development is hard. It’s difficult organizing ideas and delegating tasks between a large team. Working on project components that are dependant on other components is especially difficult. However, being able to come up with ideas, brainstorm and gain inspiration from other’s ideas is easier in this type of environment. Throughout the entire design process there seamed to be no shortage of ideas of different features and aspects we could include in our application. There is definitely a trade-off when working in a large group, but we believe that over time with more experience in this type of environment, you will be able to decrease the number of negatives.</p>
<p>In the next large-scale project, we believe that we should start including group roles within the project, such as a team leader. This will allow the group to become more organized as the team leader can delegate tasks within the group. There can also be another role in ensuring the status of the application is constantly where it should be within the development cycle. In the next large-scale project, we believe that it would benefit to continue keeping a positive attitude and encourage idea generation between your team members. This will allow everyone to contribute to the progression of the application while simultaneously speeding up how fast the project can be finished. In the next large-scale project, we believe that it would benefit to stop from tackling problems alone within the application. This type of behaviour can lead to wasted efforts in implementing code that may never see the light of day. Also, it allows the group to stay on track on implementing what was already set out to do.</p>

<h2>Improvement after iteration 2 retrospective<a class="headerlink" href="#improvement-after-iteration-2-retrospective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We believe that the improvement identified in the iteration 2 retrospective was a success. In the retrospective we discussed not being content with the state of the Manage Deck feature and especially how this feature was implemented in a persistent database environment. After following the two plans to improve our feature (i.e. less talk, more code/test &amp; following the sample project), we were successfully able to implement the Manage Deck feature and lay nice ground work for the other features that were seen in iteration 3. We can confidently say we have reached our goal because the three levels of testing discussed in the RETROSPECTIVE.md all passed with the Manage Decks feature.</p>
